/**
 * Chunk render optimizer (CRO) is an object that produces optimized models for
 * chunks. CROs are sequentially given information about the blocks and tiles of
 * a particular chunk, after which they are expected to produce a set of
 * {@link Renderable}s. As the name suggests, CROs are primarily expected to
 * output models that are optimized compared to models of individual blocks and
 * tiles. An example of a CRO is {@link ChunkRenderOptimizerSurface}: it removes
 * block surfaces and tiles that it knows cannot be seen, thus significantly
 * reducing total polygon count.
 * <p>
 * As with everything related to rendering chunks, CROs are interacted with
 * using the relative local chunk coordinate system. In this coordinate system,
 * the coordinates are the chunk coordinates relativized using the chunks's up
 * direction. In simpler terms, coordinates are {@code [0; BLOCKS_PER_CHUNK)}
 * and Z is always up.
 * <h3>CRO lifecycle</h3>
 * A CRO instance is created by {@link ChunkRenderOptimizerRegistry}. It may
 * then be used to work on multiple chunks sequentially. Each chunk is processed
 * in the following way:
 * <ol>
 * <li>{@link #setup(ChunkRender)} is invoked to provide the {@link ChunkRender}
 * instance.</li>
 * <li>{@link #startRender()} is invoked. The CRO must reset its state.</li>
 * <li>{@link #addBlock(BlockRender, Vec3i)} and
 * {@link #addTile(TileRender, Vec3i, RelFace)} are invoked for each block and
 * tile that this CRO should optimize. {@code addTile} specifies tiles in order
 * of ascension within a tile stack.</li>
 * <li>{@link #endRender()} is invoked. The CRO may perform any pending
 * calculations. The result of the optimization is returned.</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * Each CRO instance is accessed by a single thread.
