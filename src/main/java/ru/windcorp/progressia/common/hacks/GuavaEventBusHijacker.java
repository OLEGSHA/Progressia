/**
 * This class had to be written because there is no legal way to instantiate a
 * non-async {@link EventBus} with both a custom identifier and a custom
 * exception handler. Which is a shame. Guava maintainers know about the issue
 * but have rejected solutions multiple times <em>without a clearly stated
 * reason</em>; looks like some dirty reflection will have to do.
 * <p>
 * When explicitly referencing this class, please mention its usage in
 * implementation notes because it is unreliable long-term.
